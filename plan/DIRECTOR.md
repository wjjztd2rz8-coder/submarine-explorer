# Director's plan: the single source of forward work

The owner treats this as a curiosity project about how far current models and workflows can go. Claude acts as creative director: it holds the vision, reviews every package and sends work back until it is good. Most plan "rules" are Claude's own recommendations, so revise them freely and record why here.

## How this file is used (owner, 2026-10-11)

- **One source.** Every forward run takes its work only from the [Backlog](#backlog) below:
  - interactive threads;
  - headless `tools/resume.sh` runs;
  - comprehensive and targeted reviews;
  - `tools/codex-refill.sh`;
  - every Codex brief.
- **No parallel plans.** A review, owner note or audit changes this file: it adds, reorders, splits or cuts items. It never starts a parallel plan document.
  - Analysis files are evidence that items cite: reviews, audits, owner-feedback write-ups, `plan/archive/SIMPLIFY-REVIEW-2026-10-11.md`.
  - [PHASE-F-PLAN.md](PHASE-F-PLAN.md) is reference only: owner decisions and pillars. Its waves are finished.
- **IDs.** Every item has a stable ID. Codex briefs, worktree branches, `plan/progress/` notes and commit messages name the item ID they serve, for example `S-dead` or `brief 1500 (S-dead)`. Work with no backlog item doesn't start: add the item first.
- **Lanes.** Each item names a lane: **Codex** (well-specified, self-contained, and NOT visual), **Sonnet** (visual, multi-file, judgement) or **Haiku** (small and scoped). Owner 2026-10-12: Claude owns all visual work (anything judged by how it looks), because Codex cannot render the game (its browser smoke test failed on MCP approval and the browser is off). Codex may still do the numeric/geometry side of a visual item when a Claude package asks for it. Pick the highest unblocked item in your lane whose files don't overlap work in flight.
- **Status.** Mark items `IN FLIGHT (<who>, <date>)`, `DONE <date> (<commit>)` or `CUT <date>: <why>` (cuts also go in CHANGELOG.md). Delete DONE items at the next comprehensive review. History goes to `plan/archive/DIRECTOR-HISTORY-*.md`.

## Direction (standing)

- **Owner direction:**
  - Playability first, with Arcade as the default and Realistic as a deliberate alternative.
  - Cinematic realism that is readable and never frustratingly dark.
  - Real sites stay factual; plausible additions are tagged once in the Journal, with no repeated caveats.
  - Keep the HUD uncluttered.
  - Phone and tablet are first-class.
  - Every cut is logged in CHANGELOG.md.
  - Rules can bend (owner, 2026-10-22): this is an exploratory project, so a decision that is logically consistent with the rule's purpose and safe may break a hard rule, including an owner-set one, without asking. Example: shortening the 150-300 m mission opening for small subjects keeps the target out of scan range, which is what the rule was for. Record the reasoning in the progress note and update the tests that enforce the old rule.
- **Core to protect** (from the 2026-10-11 simplification review): enter a real place, pilot comfortably, approach something striking, scan it, keep the discovery in the Journal. That means:
  - real GMRT terrain;
  - the identity of all 13 sites and the five hero set pieces;
  - the scan verb;
  - the Journal;
  - marine life;
  - keyboard, pad and touch input;
  - accessibility.

  Simplify the machinery around exploration, not the exploration.

### Definition of done: simplicity rules (every package, from 2026-10-11)

Reviewers send work back if it breaks one of these:

1. **Net simpler.** Prefer merging or deleting to adding. A new on-screen element replaces or merges an existing one, and the progress note says which. New settings need a reason a player would change them.
2. **One guidance surface.** Text guidance goes through the guidance slot (S-guidance) once it lands. Until then, don't add another floating card, toast or chip.
3. **No layout patches.** Fix overlaps in the HUD layout model (S-hud), not with per-element pixel offsets or new `@media` special cases in `hud-layout.css`. If a patch is unavoidable before S-hud lands, mark it `/* S-hud: remove */`.
4. **No site branches in shared code.** Per-site tuning goes in that site's data (S-manifest). Until then, extend an existing per-site table, never an `if (siteId === ...)`.
5. **Settings resolve once.** Don't mutate `config` at runtime to apply a mode, upgrade, modifier or vehicle. Read the resolved effective settings (S-resolve).
6. **Tests by capability.** Extend an existing capability spec, or the table-driven specs from S-tests. Don't add a new package-named spec (`f-verify-NNN`, `f-bughunt-NNN`). Each new e2e test says which regression it guards. Never loosen an assertion that guards a real past bug.
7. **No package numbers in code.** Source, CSS and test comments explain _why_; package history lives in git and `plan/progress/`.

Stage (review 2026-11-01, Claude alone; Sol skipped, Codex week 5%): about 88% (range 85-89%); 4 weeks. Lost City 4.05 (tower flank now lit), Monterey 4.0, Titanic 3.9, Blue Hole 3.8 (hood still a slab), Beebe 3.8, Hunga 3.2, Kama 3.1. Previous stage (review 2026-10-30, Claude alone; Sol skipped, Codex week 6%): about 86% (range 83-88%) to 1.0; 4-5 weeks. Beautiful: Titanic 3.9, Lost City 3.9, Blue Hole 3.8, Beebe 3.7, Monterey 3.9, Challenger 3.6, Endurance 3.6. Blockers: (1) no hero firmly at 4; (2) Blue Hole and Beebe openings (gallery read, Beebe darkness); (3) real-phone Low-tier acceptance.

## Needs owner

The newest items go first.

- (Endurance 85 m opening is no longer a blocker: coherence only, per the 2026-10-25 joint review.)
- A short phone retest once the P2 items below land (boost gone, scan range, anchored events, Your sub screen).

## In flight

- No package running. Briefs 120-123 queued, waiting for the Nov 4 Codex reset. Claude lane: Sonnet items 1-5 in order.

## Backlog

One list, ordered by player impact and dependencies; lane in brackets. Evidence: review 2026-10-30 in `plan/REVIEWS.md` (Claude alone, Sol skipped for Codex budget) and golden `2026-10-30-212725`; earlier items (all DONE ones, with commits) in [archive/DIRECTOR-HISTORY-2026-10-30-backlog.md](archive/DIRECTOR-HISTORY-2026-10-30-backlog.md). Art gains per package are ~0.1-0.2, so each V-* names a target composition, not a geometry list. Owner phone decisions: [PHONE-FEEDBACK-2026-10-18.md](PHONE-FEEDBACK-2026-10-18.md).

1. **DONE 2026-11-01 (26d21bd1; seven authored stalactites + ragged lip, ~+0.2 up close, but the 24 m opening pose is 150 m out so the hood is small and the top 25% is open water: next step is an opening-pose/camera change, item V-bluehole-opening-pose) V-bluehole-hood-geometry [Sonnet] (five geometry passes failed; this brief is a TARGET COMPOSITION):** from the 24 m opening pose, the top ~25% of the frame is a dark, irregular overhang whose underside is darker than its lip, with 5-8 conical stalactites of clearly different lengths hanging from it, the sub off to one side in blue water. It must not read as a smooth dome or boat hull. Route: stalactites.ts hood profile (ribs, lip noise, underside tint) driven by Blue Hole data; judge only by a fresh great-blue-hole-1-mission.png.
2. **DONE 2026-11-01 (861fa715; tall pale sponge stacks in the foreground, partial: distant mounds still read as similar lumps, would need per-mound variety in coral.ts) V-coral-sponge-garden [Sonnet] (tint did not work; needs different silhouettes):** Blake's field reads as identical tan lumps. Add one new low-poly prop (tall vase/tube sponge cluster or dark rubble) and scatter it between the mounds via Blake data; target: two clearly different silhouettes at opening, no new tier. Keep prop cost within the coral budget test.
3. **DONE 2026-11-01 (7665ab5e; tube-worm clumps give depth layers, partial: vent stubs too dark, horizon still hard) V-beebe-seabed-read [Sonnet]:** Beebe opening (4967 m): smoker, plume and sub read well, but the seabed is a flat brown plain with a hard horizon and no second subject. Target: a faint warm pool of vent light on the near seabed plus 2-3 small chimney stubs or mussel/tube-worm patches at 20-40 m so the frame has depth layers. Data-driven via the Beebe vent preset; no site branch; opening must stay readable (not darker).
4. **V-hunga-wall-rise [Sonnet] DONE 2026-11-01 (413cfc9a, partial: wall reads as a lit bedded mass but sits mid-frame, top slightly dark):** Hunga opening shows a striped wedge in front of a faint dome; the caldera wall does not read as a wall. Target: a lit, clearly vertical wall band filling the upper-left third from the opening pose, with the pre-2022 rim label unclipped (label wraps to two lines now and runs wide).
5. **V-kama-subject [Sonnet] DONE 2026-11-01 (36772522, partial: plume base only marginally lit, far slope still dark blue-grey):** Kama'ehuakanaloa opening: the vent plume is the subject but the slope is a blotchy blue plane and the pillow lump at right is unexplained. Target: calm slope tint (no blotches) and the plume base lit; cut or move the stray lump.
6. **R-ci-speed [Codex, queued 124]:** hosted CI takes 30+ min, so failures surface 1-2 runs late. Audit shard balance and slow specs; target under 20 min without dropping coverage.
7. **Codex, queued 120-123, waiting for the Nov 4 reset:** T-opening-geometry (120), S-verify CI (121), S-dead second sweep (122), S-verify spawn cap (123).
8. **P2-phone-accept [owner + Codex; browser-checkable items automated in tests/e2e/phone-accept.spec.ts]:** checklist in `plan/progress/4410-P2-phone-accept-checklist.md`; owner runs it on the current build.
9. **R-release [Haiku]:** tag the latest green-CI main after each review (f70 is the newest, 2026-11-01).

Demoted: further Titanic sky tuning, Challenger boulders, per-site decoration, title polish, Endurance framing (CUT 2026-10-16), Titanic per-plate blockiness (accepted ~3.7). Codex weekly burn is ~60%/day, so briefs stay rationed.

## Review rubric (every package, before merge)

- **Readable in the first 10 s:** you can see the sub, the seabed and something interesting.
- **Beautiful:** looks like a documentary still, not a prototype.
- **Simple:** a new player understands what to do without reading much, and the package meets the simplicity rules above.
- **Rewarding:** there's something to find, and it feels good to find it.
- **Honest:** real sites are factual and additions are tagged once.
- **Phone-OK:** a touch layout with no overlaps, and the low tier still looks good.

If it fails, send it back to the same agent or Codex session with concrete feedback (what's wrong, which screenshot, what good looks like). Don't merge and fix later.

## Golden screenshots

`tools/golden.sh` captures the hero sites at fixed poses plus the first loaded default mission frame at all 13 sites into `.cache/golden/<date>/`, with one shared `index.html` and build provenance. `GOLDEN_MODE=free-dive` limits a run to hero poses; `GOLDEN_MODE=mission` retains the three-layout mission opening/+10 s sweep. Compare the newest set with the previous one after any visual merge. A merge must not make them worse.

Use `node tools/golden-compare.mjs <before-dir> <after-dir>` for numeric review:
two RGB byte levels of tolerance, with larger differences limited to 0.1% of
pixels per image. It rejects incomplete sets and changed poses/options. Exit 1
flags changes for review; exit 2 means the inputs cannot be compared. `--report`
retains metrics without failing on pixel changes. This screen does not replace
Claude's visual judgement or make captures across art changes equivalent.
