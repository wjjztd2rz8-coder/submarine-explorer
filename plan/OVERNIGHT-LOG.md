# Overnight log

Append-only notes from timed headless orchestrator runs, for the owner to read in the morning.

- 2026-09-24 00:10 CDT headless run: skipped: orchestrator active (lock 'interactive', 7 min old)

## 2026-09-24 00:31 (interactive thread)

- Merged tonight: D-SONAR, D-POLISH (owner playtest #2 fixes), D-POWER, D-CURRENTS, D-ROV. All gates green on main.
- D-PHOTO: Codex hit its limit at 00:30 (back 3:16 AM). A Claude Opus subagent is finishing it in /home/vijay/subexp-wt/d-photo; the interactive thread will review and merge it.
- Remaining after D-PHOTO: docs reconciliation (README, docs/architecture.md, plan/STATUS.md Phase D section, MASTER-PLAN §6).

## 2026-09-24 01:16 (interactive thread): Phase D complete

- Merged: D-PHOTO (Codex started it, and a Claude Opus subagent finished it after the Codex limit), then the docs reconciliation (README controls table, architecture, settings, STATUS with a playtest #3 checklist, MASTER-PLAN). Full gates are green on main (fe918dc).
- The overnight timer was stopped: no Phase D work remains. Nothing has been pushed.
- Next for the owner: playtest #3 (checklist in plan/STATUS.md), then the go-ahead for the GitHub repo and Pages.
