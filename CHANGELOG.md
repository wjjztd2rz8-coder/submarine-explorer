# Changelog

All notable changes to Submarine Explorer are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). The project has no
version numbers yet, so entries are grouped under **Unreleased** by phase and
package.

**Rule: every cut or redesign is logged here**, under **Removed** or
**Changed**, with a one-line reason. That covers dropped features, removed
content, replaced systems and changed defaults. A package that cuts something
without an entry here is not done.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Phase F, F1-GEO: **geology and biology set pieces** (`src/world/props/geo/`,
  new prop kind `procedural:geo` and props.json `feature`). A black-smoker mound
  (Axial ASHES; Beebe, with shrimp swarms) with tubeworm clumps, bacterial mats
  and animated smoke plumes; the Poseidon carbonate tower at Lost City (fluted
  spires, flanges, talus skirt); Lophelia coral mounds with instanced branching
  colonies and vase sponges (Blake Plateau, Hudson Canyon); a drowned karst
  alcove with fluted stalactites and sponges on the Lighthouse Reef drop-off; a
  pillow-lava heap with iron mats at Kamaehuakanaloa; and extruded scarps with
  strata, gullies and boulder aprons for the Hunga Tonga caldera wall, the
  Monterey Canyon wall and the Challenger Deep north wall. Existing chimneys gain
  a flowstone or cracked-rock detail texture. Every piece is procedural (canvas
  textures, no third-party assets), has compound colliders and scales with the
  quality tier (colony and plume counts, mesh density, texture size, bump map).
  Plumes animate entirely in the vertex shader. Dev preview: `/preview/geo.html`.
- Phase F, F1-WRECKS: **hand-built wrecks** (`src/world/props/wrecks/`). Titanic
  bow and stern, Bismarck and Endurance are now lofted hulls with decks, deck
  houses, funnels, turrets, masts, rigging, rusticle curtains, sessile growth and
  procedural plate/rust textures, replacing the plain hull block. Debris fields
  (boilers, Titanic field, Bismarck turrets and landslide, Endurance rigging) use
  instanced scatter kits. Detail scales with the quality tier (growth, railings,
  openings, texture size, normal maps, LOD distances). Each wreck has an
  `interior-entry` anchor for later interior work. Hulls use compound colliders so
  the sub can drop between deck houses. Dev preview: `/preview/wrecks.html`.
- Phase F, F1-VEHICLES: **procedural vehicle kit** (`src/vehicles/`). The hero
  sub is now a detailed deep-submergence vehicle in three distinct hull
  classes (A coastal, B deep ocean, C full ocean depth; chosen by the fitted
  hull): pressure-sphere viewport, syntactic-foam fairings, thrusters with
  animated props, strobes, manipulator arms, sled, decals and bubbles. The ROV
  is a detailed work-class vehicle with a sagging tether that straightens at the
  limit. First person looks out through a cockpit viewport frame that is
  never dark. Detail scales with the quality tier (the low tier builds a
  simplified LOD with no textures, wash or decals). `SubMesh` and `RovVisual`
  keep their public API.

- Phase F, F0-CORE: **quality tiers v2** (`src/core/Quality.ts`,
  `src/core/config/quality.ts`). There are now four tiers (`low`, `medium`,
  `high`, `ultra`) plus an `auto` setting. `auto` detects a tier from the GPU
  string, GPU limits, core count, device memory and mobile hints (mobile user
  agent, coarse pointer with no hover, screen size). `?tier=auto` forces
  detection.
- Phase F, F0-CORE: **dynamic resolution**. When the tier was auto-detected, the
  pixel ratio steps down while the smoothed frame time is over budget and steps
  back up when there is headroom. `?dynres=1` forces it on and `?dynres=0`
  turns it off.
- Phase F, F0-CORE: **`window.__game.perf`** reports draw calls and triangles
  (post pass included), smoothed frame time, the tier and how it was chosen,
  the pixel ratio and the resolution scale. `window.__game.quality` holds the
  tier decision.
- Phase F, F0-CORE: **asset service** (`src/core/assets/`). It has GLTF, Draco,
  Meshopt and KTX2 loaders, a glTF cache and a texture cache, and a typed
  `AssetManifest` with `preload()`. Props GLB loading now goes through it. The
  Basis KTX2 transcoder is vendored in `public/assets/decoders/basis/`. The
  build strips three's default decoder URLs so no second copy of the Draco or
  Basis files ships.
- Phase F, F0-CORE: **Auto** and **Ultra** entries in Settings → Graphics tier.

### Changed

- Phase F, F1-GEO: `poseidon-tower` (Lost City) and `beebe-chimney-1` are now
  hand-built vent set pieces instead of plain chimney columns; they stay
  `procedural:chimney` with a `feature`, so the vent preset still smokes them. Blake
  Plateau keeps its two boulder stand-ins beside the new coral mound. The Hudson
  Canyon `props.json` note that no coral model exists was removed (one now does).

- F1-VEHICLES: the ROV fill light moved from 3.6 m to about 9 m from the float (intensity x3) and vehicle materials gained a highlight shoulder, because pale livery inside the boat's own headlight beams clipped to flat white. The old single-mesh hull and ROV models are replaced, not kept as an option.
- Phase F, F0-CORE: **`main.ts` split into systems** (`src/app/`). There is one
  file per system under `src/app/systems/`, each with init, per-frame stage
  hooks and dispose. The ordered registration list lives in
  `src/app/systems.ts`, the frame loop in `src/app/loop.ts` and boot in
  `src/app/boot.ts`. Behaviour, frame order, listener order and the
  `window.__game` contract are unchanged (new keys only).
- Phase F, F0-CORE: **`styles.css` split** into per-module files under
  `src/styles/`, imported by `src/styles.css` in the original cascade order. No
  selector changed.
- Phase F, F0-CORE: **`Config.ts` split**. Per-domain types and defaults now
  live in `src/core/config/*.ts`, and the `GameConfig` contract lives in
  `src/core/config/types.ts`. `src/core/Config.ts` stays the import path and
  still exports `makeConfig`. Default values are unchanged.
- Phase F, F0-CORE: **procedural prop builders split** into
  `src/world/props/builders/` (`wrecks`, `debris`, `vents`, `reefs`, `geology`,
  `generic`, `shared`), with a kind → builder registry.
  `src/world/props/Procedural.ts` re-exports them for compatibility.
- Phase F, F0-CORE: saved settings accept `auto` and `ultra` for the graphics
  tier. Existing `low`, `medium` and `high` saves are kept as they are. The
  default stays `medium`, so a fresh install looks the same as before.
