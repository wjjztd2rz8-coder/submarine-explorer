# Changelog

All notable changes to Submarine Explorer are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). The project has no
version numbers yet, so entries are grouped under **Unreleased** by phase and
package.

**Rule: every cut or redesign is logged here**, under **Removed** or
**Changed**, with a one-line reason. That covers dropped features, removed
content, replaced systems and changed defaults. A package that cuts something
without an entry here is not done.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Phase F, F0-CORE: **quality tiers v2** (`src/core/Quality.ts`,
  `src/core/config/quality.ts`). There are now four tiers (`low`, `medium`,
  `high`, `ultra`) plus an `auto` setting. `auto` detects a tier from the GPU
  string, GPU limits, core count, device memory and mobile hints (mobile user
  agent, coarse pointer with no hover, screen size). `?tier=auto` forces
  detection.
- Phase F, F0-CORE: **dynamic resolution**. When the tier was auto-detected, the
  pixel ratio steps down while the smoothed frame time is over budget and steps
  back up when there is headroom. `?dynres=1` forces it on and `?dynres=0`
  turns it off.
- Phase F, F0-CORE: **`window.__game.perf`** reports draw calls and triangles
  (post pass included), smoothed frame time, the tier and how it was chosen,
  the pixel ratio and the resolution scale. `window.__game.quality` holds the
  tier decision.
- Phase F, F0-CORE: **asset service** (`src/core/assets/`). It has GLTF, Draco,
  Meshopt and KTX2 loaders, a glTF cache and a texture cache, and a typed
  `AssetManifest` with `preload()`. Props GLB loading now goes through it. The
  Basis KTX2 transcoder is vendored in `public/assets/decoders/basis/`. The
  build strips three's default decoder URLs so no second copy of the Draco or
  Basis files ships.
- Phase F, F0-CORE: **Auto** and **Ultra** entries in Settings → Graphics tier.

### Changed

- Phase F, F0-CORE: **`main.ts` split into systems** (`src/app/`). There is one
  file per system under `src/app/systems/`, each with init, per-frame stage
  hooks and dispose. The ordered registration list lives in
  `src/app/systems.ts`, the frame loop in `src/app/loop.ts` and boot in
  `src/app/boot.ts`. Behaviour, frame order, listener order and the
  `window.__game` contract are unchanged (new keys only).
- Phase F, F0-CORE: **`styles.css` split** into per-module files under
  `src/styles/`, imported by `src/styles.css` in the original cascade order. No
  selector changed.
- Phase F, F0-CORE: **`Config.ts` split**. Per-domain types and defaults now
  live in `src/core/config/*.ts`, and the `GameConfig` contract lives in
  `src/core/config/types.ts`. `src/core/Config.ts` stays the import path and
  still exports `makeConfig`. Default values are unchanged.
- Phase F, F0-CORE: **procedural prop builders split** into
  `src/world/props/builders/` (`wrecks`, `debris`, `vents`, `reefs`, `geology`,
  `generic`, `shared`), with a kind → builder registry.
  `src/world/props/Procedural.ts` re-exports them for compatibility.
- Phase F, F0-CORE: saved settings accept `auto` and `ultra` for the graphics
  tier. Existing `low`, `medium` and `high` saves are kept as they are. The
  default stays `medium`, so a fresh install looks the same as before.
